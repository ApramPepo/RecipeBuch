    <h3><strong><em>Steps</em></strong></h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>Step 1: Boil the macaroni</h4>
    <p>First, boil the macaroni according to the instructions on the packet, bringing them to al dente. I like to add a generous pinch of salt to the water as well. Drain, wash with cold water, and set aside.</p>
    <h4>Step 2: Make the cheese sauce</h4>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 350F before getting started. <br>
        Now let's make the cheese sauce! Start by melting butter in a large saucepan / Dutch oven pan on medium-low heat. Once the butter is melted, add the flour and stir for 1-2 minutes to toast the flour. <br> Add the salt and spices, and stir for another minute or so to cook the spices. Now, add the milk and cream. Stir until the mixture comes to a boil. <br>
        Then add the cream cheese and whisk it in. At this point, you can turn off the heat. Now, just stir in the cheese mixture, adding them a little at a time and mixing until they are melted in. <br>
        You should have a creamy cheese sauce. It should not be too thick, as it will thicken up more during baking. Stir in the boiled macaroni. Taste and adjust the spices and salt as needed.</p>

    <h4>Step 3: Assemble</h4>
    <p>In a casserole dish (I use a 7x11" ceramic dish), add half of the Mac And Cheese mixture and spread it out. Sprinkle over a layer of cheese. <br> Then cover with the remaining Mac And Cheese, and top off with the remaining cheese. Sprinkle over chopped parsley, and a little paprika. </p>
    <h4>Step 4: Bake</h4>
    <p>Now it's time to bake! Place the dish in the oven and bake for ~15 minutes. Then switch to broil, and broil until the cheese on top is melted and golden.</p>
    <h4>Step 5: Serve</h4>
    <p>That's it. It is now time to enjoy this delicious Baked Mac And Cheese!</p>
